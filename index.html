        <p> 
            I began working with computers in high school, where I studied HTML, CSS, and photoshop. 
            After studying Accounting for three years at Georgia College, I re-discovered my interest in coding and began working towards an IT career instead. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of coding, I spend my time playing in bands, playing for various rugby clubs, and doing freelance carpentry.
            I began doing contracting work with my dad when I was a young teenager, 
            and spent the majority the past year working 45 hours a week for a cabinet shop in Roswell. 
            At the same time, I was taking 15 hour semesters working on a Computer Info Systems degree (with an App Development concentration) from Georgia State University. 
            I currently have about 5 classes left in my CIS program, which focuses on Java and project management methodologies such as Scrum, XP, and Waterfall.
